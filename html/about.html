                    <p> <span style = "font-family: Rock Salt; font-size: 60px">Hi,</span> my name is Anna Do. I've been meaning to put together a website for awhile. That's me in the picture on the left. I'm being a kid at Ikea in the kid's section. Anyways, I'm a senior at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science. I'm graduating this spring of 2015 and moving to Chicago in the summer to work as a Software Engineer at Orbitz. I built this website to combine all of the projects i've made while in college and outside of college and to practice my web design skills. Other than programming, I enjoy digital animation, web design, graphic design, photography. And also making music on the guitar, piano, and just recently, ukelele. I also like knitting, reading, and learning new things. You won't learn everything about me from this badly put together bio, so feel free to contact me. Just go to my <a href = "contacts.html">contact</a> page that I worked hard to put together. Have a good day! </p>
